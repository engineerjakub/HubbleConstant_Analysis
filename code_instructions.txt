instructions for assignment_code

1. run the code. two figures will show up.
2. one of the first figures, labelled 'Cepheid period-luminosity relation' is for stage 1.
3. all the values are printed on the figure.
4. for numbers from stage 2 onwards, they are listed in the terminal. 
5. all data is labelled by its galaxy, the numbers correspond with the positions in the data files
i.e. the first number for galaxy IC4182 will correspond for the first cepheid, and so forth.
6. the distances and their errors in parsecs are listed separately. they are easy to read as they are labelled individually.
7. the last 'set' of numbers include the chi-square, the value for a reduced chi-square test
as well as the hubble constant, its error, the age of the universe, and its error.
8. the second figure therefore shows the plot for the hubble constant.

# Hubble Constant & Age of the Universe

In this project, you will find an analysis of cepheid data, the manipulation of relevant equations in order to obtain the Hubble Constant.

The age of the universe is inversely proportional to the hubble constant. Therefore the ultimate goal is to determine this number.

Once obtained, it is compared to secondary sources. Indeed, in this project, I found the age of the universe to be 13.77 billion years old.
According to a 2021 paper, the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years old;

Following the implementation of the code, the results were presented in:
- A report describing all the mathematical logic and findings
- A presentation

This data was presented to professors and students at the University of Southampton.
